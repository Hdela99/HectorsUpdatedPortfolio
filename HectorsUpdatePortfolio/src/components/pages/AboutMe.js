            <h2>I am Hector</h2>
            <p> I am an upcoming full-stack developer that is passionate in learning as much as possible whether it be new frameworks, programming/markup languages, unit testing, or industry standard practices. While my current stack consists of the generic MERN stack I aspire to become more flexible and am always learning new things to make my coding more efficient while also being accessible to improve SEO performance. A developer is only as good as their ability to learn and adapt and I am proud to say that I consider myself an expert at adapting to work environments. </p>
